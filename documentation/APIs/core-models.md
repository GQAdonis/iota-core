### Block Signature
This is how the signature is generated:

* `content` is the serialized block **without** signature and nonce.
* `slot_commitment_ID` is the identifier calculated from the Slot Commitment within the block, following steps described in [Slot Commitment ID](#slot-commitment-id) section.
* `Issuing Time` is the block issuing time.

Calculation:
1. `content_hash` = hash(`content`)
2. `data` = Concat(`Issuing Time`, `slot_commitment_ID`, `content_hash`)
3. And sign with the Issuer PubKey, `Signature` = Sign(`data`) 

Including `Issuing Time` explicitly in the signature makes the signature verification work exactly the same as a block's. So one can prove that the block existed, the content and Slot Commitment are correct, and the Issuing Time is valid.

### Block ID
Block ID denotes an identifier of a block, with type `ArrayBytes[40]`. It is calculated as the following steps, using BLAKE2b-256 hash function:

* `content` is the serialized block **without** signature and nonce.
* `slot_index` is the slot index of the `Issuing Time` of the block.
   **Note**: It's **not** the same slot index as in the Slot Commitment.
* `signatureBytes` is the serialized signature.

Calculation:
1. `content_hash` = hash(`content`)
2. `id` = hash(Concat(`content_hash`, signatureBytes))
3. And finally, `BlockID` = Concat(`id`, `slot_index`) 

The string format of Block ID is hexadecimal encoding of Block ID with `0x` prefix.

### Block Syntactic Validation Rules

* Block size must not exceeds `MaxBlockSize` bytes, currently is `32768`.
* `Protocol Version` must match the `Protocol Version` config parameter of the node.
* It must hold true that 1 ≤ `Strong Parents Count` ≤ 8.
* It must hold true that 0 ≤ `Weak Parents Count` ≤ 8.
* It must hold true that 0 ≤ `Shallow Like Parents Count` ≤ 8.
* `Strong Parents`, `Weak Parents`, `Shallow Like Parents` must be lexically ordered.
* `Strong Parents`, `Weak Parents`, `Shallow Like Parents` must not have duplicates in each list.
* `Weak Parents` must be disjunct to the rest of the parents, no weak parent should be in either strong or shallow like parents.
* `Payload Type` must match one of the values described under Payloads.
  Data Fields must be correctly parsable in the context of the `Payload Type`.
  The payload itself must pass syntactic validation.
* `Signature` must be valid.
* There must be no trailing bytes after all block fields have been parsed.



## Slot Index

Timeline is divided into slots, and each slot has a corresponding slot index, which is a `uint64`.
To calculate the slot index of a timestamp, `genesisTimestamp` and the duration of a slot are needed.
The slot index of timestamp `ts` is `(ts - genesisTimestamp)/duration + 1`.

## Slot Commitment

Slot Commitment is an object that contains a summary of a slot, and it is linked to the commitment of the previous slot, which forms a commitment chain. 

**Note**: Slot Commitment and Commitment may be used interchangeably in this file and other API files. 

Multiple sparse merkle trees are managed per slot, which are:
* *Tangle tree*: All accepted blocks within a slot.
* *State mutation tree*: All accepted transactions within a slot.
* *Activity tree*: All active accounts within a slot.
* *State tree*: All accepted created/consumed outputs within a slot.
* *Mana tree*: Mana of all accounts at the end of a slot.

A slot is committable after waiting `MinCommittableSlotAge` slots from the current one. When a slot is committable, new commitment is generated and will be included in the new issued blocks. so the slot index in a slot commitment is always lagged behind of the block's slot index, which is its `Issuing Time`.

**Note** that more trees will be added in the future, but this will only change the calculation of `Root ID`, the Slot Commitment structure stays the same.

The following table describes the serialization of a Slot Commitment:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Index</td>
    <td>uint64</td>
    <td>
      The slot index of this commitment. It is calculated based on genesis timestamp and the duration of a slot.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Previous Slot Commitment ID</td>
    <td>ByteArray[40]</td>
    <td>The commitment ID of the previous slot.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Roots ID</td>
    <td>ByteArray[32]</td>
    <td>
      A BLAKE2b-256 hash of concatenating multiple sparse merkle tree roots of a slot.
      <i>Root ID = hash( Concat( hash(Concat(Tangle, TX)), hash(Concat(State, Mana)) ) )</i>  
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cumulative Weight</td>
    <td>uint64</td>
    <td>The sum of previous slot commitment cumulative weight and weight of issuers of accepted blocks within this slot. It is just an indication of "committed into" this slot, and can not strictly be used for evaluating the switching of a chain.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Slot Commitment ID

Slot Commitment ID denotes an identifier of a slot commitment, with type `ArrayBytes[40]`. It is calculated as the following steps, using BLAKE2b-256 hash function:

* `content` is the serialized slot commitment.
* `slot_index` is the slot index of the slot commitment.

Calculation:
1. `content_hash` = hash(`content`)
2. And finally, `CommitmentID` = Concat(`content_hash`, `slot_index`) 

The string format of Slot Commitment ID is hexadecimal encoding of Slot Commitment ID with `0x` prefix.

## Payloads
The following table lists all currently specified payloads that can be part of a block. 

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Payload Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Tagged Data</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>A payload which holds a tag and associated data.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Transaction</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>A payload which holds a transaction with its inputs, outputs and unlocks.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Tagged Data payload

Tagged Data payload holds a tag and associated data.
The following table describes the serialization of a Tagged payload:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Payload Type</td>
        <td>uint32</td>
        <td>The payload type of Tagged Data payload is 5.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Tag</td>
        <td>(uint8)ByteArray</td>
        <td>The tag to use to categorize the data in binary form. A leading uint8 denotes its length.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Data</td>
        <td>(uint32)ByteArray</td>
        <td>Binary data. A leading uint32 denotes its length.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### Tagged Payload Syntactic Validation Rules
* The length of a Tag must < `64` bytes.
* The length of the Data must < `8192` bytes.
